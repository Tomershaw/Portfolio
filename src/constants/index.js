        "I have acquired practical skills in both front-end and back-end development through the course. On the front-end side, I have gained knowledge and experience in essential web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have expertise in popular frameworks like Angular and React, which have equipped me to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. In terms of back-end development, I possess proficiency in languages such as C# and have hands-on experience with frameworks like ASP.NET Core. This expertise enables me to build server-side applications that are scalable and efficient. Furthermore, I have extensive experience working with databases, particularly SQL Server, and utilizing version control systems like Git. These skills contribute to my ability to handle end-to-end development tasks and deliver robust software solutions.",
